<h2><u>Introduction to Web App Exploitation</u></h2>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Web application exploitation is the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or compromise the security of the application and its users. It involves understanding how web applications work, identifying potential security flaws, and leveraging them to achieve malicious objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> Web applications are software programs that run on web servers and interact with users through web browsers. They often handle sensitive data and perform critical functions, making them attractive targets for attackers.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Web applications are susceptible to various security risks, including injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), authentication and authorization flaws, insecure configuration, and sensitive data exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>Attack Surface:</strong> The attack surface of a web application refers to the sum of all possible entry points and vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit to compromise the application. Common attack surfaces include input fields, HTTP headers, cookies, and server-side components.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding Vulnerabilities:</strong> Learn about common web application vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited by attackers to compromise security.</li>
  <li><strong>Practical Exploitation:</strong> Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques used for identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities in controlled environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Awareness:</strong> Raise awareness about the importance of secure coding practices, vulnerability management, and security testing in the development and maintenance of web applications.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Web application exploitation covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and remediation. It encompasses both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) perspectives, focusing on proactive security measures and incident response.</p>

<h2><u>Understanding HTTP Protocols</u></h2>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Understanding HTTP protocols is essential for web application exploitation as it forms the basis of client-server communication, data exchange, and request-response mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTTP Basics:</strong> HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypertext documents between a client (e.g., web browser) and a server (e.g., web server). It operates over TCP/IP and follows a client-server architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Request-Response Model:</strong> HTTP follows a request-response model, where the client sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve or manipulate resources, and the server responds with HTTP responses containing the requested data or status codes.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> HTTP defines several methods (also known as verbs) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and OPTIONS (retrieve server capabilities).</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP Headers:</strong> HTTP headers provide additional information about HTTP requests and responses, such as the content type, content length, cookies, caching directives, and authentication tokens. Headers are used for controlling and customizing the behavior of HTTP transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Status Codes:</strong> HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of HTTP requests and responses. Status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into five categories: informational (1xx), success (2xx), redirection (3xx), client errors (4xx), and server errors (5xx).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Protocol Understanding:</strong> Gain a comprehensive understanding of the HTTP protocol, including its structure, components, and functionalities.</li>
  <li><strong>Message Exchange:</strong> Learn how HTTP messages are exchanged between clients and servers, including the format of HTTP requests and responses.</li>
  <li><strong>Request Methods:</strong> Understand the purpose and usage of different HTTP methods and their implications for web application security and exploitation.</li>
  <li><strong>Header Manipulation:</strong> Explore techniques for manipulating HTTP headers to control and customize the behavior of HTTP transactions, such as user-agent spoofing, cookie tampering, and cache poisoning.</li>
  <li><strong>Status Code Analysis:</strong> Interpret HTTP status codes to diagnose and troubleshoot web application issues, identify security vulnerabilities, and understand the outcome of HTTP transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Understanding HTTP protocols covers fundamental concepts and principles related to HTTP communication, message formats, methods, headers, and status codes. It serves as the foundation for advanced topics in web application security, exploitation, and defense.</p>

<h2><u>Common Web Vulnerabilities</u></h2>

<h3><u>SQL Injection (SQLI)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> SQL injection (SQLI) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By exploiting SQL injection flaws, attackers can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify database contents, and execute arbitrary SQL commands.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker inserts malicious SQL code into input fields of a login form to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application's backend database.</p>

<h3><u>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping, allowing attackers to execute scripts in the context of other users' browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker injects a malicious script into a comment field of a web application, causing the script to execute when other users view the page, leading to session hijacking or data theft.</p>

<h3><u>Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows user input to directly modify templates or template engines on the server-side. SSTI attacks enable attackers to execute arbitrary code within the application's server environment, leading to data leaks, remote code execution, or server compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker injects malicious template code into a web application's input field, which is then processed by the server-side template engine, resulting in server-side code execution.</p>

<h3><u>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request, such as changing their email address or transferring funds, using the victim's authenticated session.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker creates a malicious webpage containing a hidden form that submits a request to change the victim's password on a targeted website when the victim visits the page while authenticated.</p>

<h3><u>Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes sensitive resources, such as database records or files, directly to users without proper authorization checks. IDOR vulnerabilities enable attackers to manipulate object references in requests to access unauthorized data.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker modifies the numeric identifier in a URL to access another user's private profile or confidential document without proper authentication or authorization.</p>

<h3><u>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</u></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate server-side requests initiated by the application. SSRF attacks enable attackers to send requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server, leading to unauthorized data access, server compromise, or network reconnaissance.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability in a web application to access sensitive files on the server, retrieve AWS metadata, or perform port scanning on internal network resources.</p>

<h2><u>Web Directory Brute Forcing</u></h2>

<p>Web directory brute forcing is a technique used to discover hidden or unlinked directories and files on a web server by systematically guessing and testing directory and file paths. This process involves sending HTTP requests to the server with different directory and file names in order to identify accessible resources that may not be directly linked from the website's pages.</p>

<h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>

<p><strong> Dirb: </strong> It is a popular web directory brute forcing tool that is used to discover hidden directories and files on web servers. It performs dictionary-based attacks by testing a list of common directory and file names against the target web server. Dirb is highly configurable and allows users to specify custom wordlists, extensions, and other options for directory enumeration.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Usage:</strong></li><ul>
<li>dirb http://example.com /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
</li></ul></ul>

<p><strong> Wfuzz: </strong> Wfuzz is another powerful web directory brute forcing tool that supports both GET and POST parameter fuzzing. It allows users to customize their attacks by specifying payloads, encodings, headers, and other options. Wfuzz is particularly useful for discovering hidden directories and files, as well as identifying vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injection, and LFI.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Usage:</strong></li><ul>
<li> wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/common.txt --hc 404 http://example.com/FUZZ
</li> </ul> </ul>

<p>These commands will perform web directory brute forcing against the target URL using the specified wordlist, allowing you to discover hidden directories and files on the web server.</p>
